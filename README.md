# ScholarshipIdentifier
Uses Student GPA, Major, and Classification to determine which scholarships they qualify for.


This program was created for a Professor of Computer Science at Mcneese University. There was a list of scholarships for Engineering and Computer Science students and I was asked to create a program that, when given student data, will be able to determine which students qualify for a scholarship. Along with that, it will also print for each student, which scholarshhips they qualify for. The data input of the scholarships and student data is xml.
